# Can Knockdown Carnival Game

## Overview
This project is a modular carnival can knockdown game developed for Second Life, showcasing an innovative approach to player interaction and game mechanics. Designed to enhance user engagement, the game features direct avatar-based play, enabling immediate gameplay without additional setup.

## Features
- **Modular Game Design:** Allows for flexible game setup with auto-resetting cans, providing a dynamic and immersive gameplay experience.
- **State Management:** Implements state management for tracking game states, in-game currency transactions, and player scores.
- **Innovative Avatar Interaction:** Utilizes direct avatar interaction for ball throwing, eliminating the need for pre-game setup and making the game accessible to all players instantly.
- **Physics-based Interaction:** Works with Second Life's in-game physics to detect can knockdowns, adding realism and complexity to the gameplay.

## Technical Highlights
- Modularity was important. The game allows for choosing how many cans you want to be spawned and they will be stacked up accordingly. You can also move and rotate the game freely and the can spawn position will be relative to the base.
- Gameplay is self contained. Typically, within Second Life, games at the time of building this that used physics to shoot an object required users to attach an object to their avatar that would spawn the shot object. This required users to have permissions to create objects within someones in game land. Instead this game took account of a users position, rotation, and a ball speed, to shoot a ball from right in front of the players position. Allowing for easier instant playability upon setup and less steps for the player to start playing.

## Player Experience
Players can start the game with a simple payment in in-game currency, engage in a straightforward yet challenging task of knocking down cans with a thrown ball, and enjoy an intuitive scoring system that rewards their skill and accuracy.
